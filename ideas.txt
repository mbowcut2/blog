Potential Topics for Blog Posts:

- Gabriel's Horn. Convergent sum vs divergent surface area. This could be useful in exploring convergence generally.

- It would be fun to do some posts on microeconomic/game theory. Maybe run some simulations of interesting games and such.

- Look at difference in statistics across sports. Which is hardest, most variance in skill, most luck, etc. based on stats like win/loss ratio, elo ratings or whatnot.
This comes from the very interesting discovery I made a few years ago that MLB win percentages are usually not much higher than .600. So, the game is almost too balanced.

- Ideas about predictive modeling. The idea of inferring a higher-dimensional reality from observations here. 4D playground. Maybe revisit some TPM readings.

- Healthcare economics deep dive. (This would probably be too political) How do/should health insurance work. Are there perverse incentives? What do we do about it?
